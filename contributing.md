I welcome contributions large and small, and I'm happy to help new developers gets started working on public code.

If you have a feature idea or discover a bug, please open an issue so we can discuss it before you spend too much time trying to implement a solution.

If you have code the addresses an issue, please make a reference to the issue in a comment on your pull request so it is easy to see the connections. If you just want to refactor some code that is messier than it should be just go ahead and open a pull request when you're ready.

I have not setup ESLint on this project as it is designed to be an unopintionated starting point. It has ESLint in the package file but no standard is enabled.

I want to give contributors as much credit as reasonably possible, so I may provide you feedback on your pull request instead of just merging and fixing the issues myself. That's meant to be helpful, but if it gets frustrating please let me know and I'll try to find another way to move it forward.
